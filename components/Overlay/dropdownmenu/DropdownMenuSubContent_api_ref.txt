Props:
name='as_child' type_=reflex.vars.Var[bool] description=' Change the default rendered element for the one passed as a child, merging their props and behavior. Defaults to False.'

name='side_offset' type_=reflex.vars.Var[typing.Union[float, int]] description=' The distance in pixels from the trigger. Defaults to 0.'
name='align_offset' type_=reflex.vars.Var[typing.Union[float, int]] description=' An offset in pixels from the "start" or "end" alignment options.'
name='avoid_collisions' type_=reflex.vars.Var[bool] description=' When true, overrides the side and align preferences to prevent collisions with boundary edges. Defaults to True.'
name='collision_padding' type_=reflex.vars.Var[typing.Union[float, int, typing.Dict[str, typing.Union[float, int]]]] description=' The distance in pixels from the boundary edges where collision detection should occur. Accepts a number (same for all sides), or a partial padding object, for example: { "top": 20, "left": 20 }. Defaults to 0.'
name='arrow_padding' type_=reflex.vars.Var[typing.Union[float, int]] description=' The padding between the arrow and the edges of the content. If your content has border-radius, this will prevent it from overflowing the corners. Defaults to 0.'
