Script
Next.js script component.

    Note that this component differs from reflex.components.base.document.NextScript
    in that it is intended for use with custom and user-defined scripts.

    It also differs from reflex.components.base.link.ScriptTag, which is the plain
    HTML <script> tag which does not work when rendering a component.
